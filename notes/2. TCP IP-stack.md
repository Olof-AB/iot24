# TCP vs UDP, ICMP, and Raw Packet Crafting in C++

## The TCP/IP Protocol Stack

Let's enter the real world! The TCP/IP model is the first of several communication stacks that we will study during this course. You use it every single day, just by _thinking_ about your phone. Every piece of data transmitted across internet traverse the TCP/IP-stack in some shape or form[^1].

The TCP/IP model is a simplified, practical version of the OSI model.

| OSI Layer       | TCP/IP Layer  | Protocol Examples                           |
| --------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| 7. Application  | Application   | HTTP, MQTT, CoAP, FTP, DNS                  |
| 6. Presentation | ⤷ Application | TLS, SSL, encryption and encoding functions |
| 5. Session      | ⤷ Application | Session tokens, WebSockets                  |
| 4. Transport    | Transport     | TCP, UDP                                    |
| 3. Network      | Internet      | IP, ICMP, IGMP                              |
| 2. Data Link    | Link          | Ethernet, WiFi MAC, ARP                     |
| 1. Physical     | ⤷ Link        | 802.11, Bluetooth, RS-232, LoRa, ZigBee PHY |

In this mapping:

- The **Application layer** in TCP/IP covers OSI layers 5–7.
- The **Link layer** in TCP/IP covers OSI layers 1–2.
- TCP/IP focuses on **interoperability and implementation**, not separation of concerns.

This chapter will focus on **TCP, UDP, and ICMP**, and how they operate at the **transport and internet layers**.

### Embedded View: What Layers Really Exist?

On a device like an ESP32 or STM32 running a bare-metal application or RTOS:

- You typically **don't see the OSI layers** — just a socket API.
- Encryption (TLS) is often optional and handled by a separate library (e.g., mbedTLS).
- Session management is minimal or custom (e.g., MQTT keep-alives).
- The actual "stack" might look like:

```text
[ App logic ]        --> your C++ program
[ MQTT / HTTP ]      --> application protocol
[ TLS / JSON ]       --> optional security/formatting
[ TCP or UDP ]       --> transport layer
[ IPv4 / IPv6 ]      --> network layer
[ WiFi / BLE / LoRa ]--> link + physical layers
```

### Protocol Placement in IoT (by Layer)

| Layer       | Protocols / Functions                   |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Application | MQTT, CoAP, HTTP, Modbus, LwM2M         |
| Transport   | UDP (CoAP), TCP (MQTT, HTTP)            |
| Internet    | IPv4, IPv6, 6LoWPAN, ICMP               |
| Link        | WiFi MAC, BLE, Ethernet, IEEE 802.15.4  |
| Physical    | RF transceivers (BLE PHY, LoRa, ZigBee) |

### Note on 6LoWPAN

- A **header compression layer** enabling IPv6 over low-bandwidth radio networks (802.15.4).
- Sits **between** the Internet and Link layers.
- Common in smart home and industrial IoT setups (used with **Thread**, **ZigBee IP**).

## TCP vs UDP

### TCP – Transmission Control Protocol

The TCP protocol is **connection-oriented**. That means that before any data is sent, we first have to establish a connection. We do that using the **3-way handshake**. For some reason there are a lot of weird handshaking going on in computer communications and I'm proud to announce that I'm not including any introvert computer nerd stereotypes in this chapter.

The TCP protocol is for this reason **reliable**. There are a lot of smart things going on. It can divide large amounts of data into smaller **packets** and send them across the Internet. Each packet is then assembled in the correct order, and they are checked for errors. If there are errors, the TCP protocol will not accept the package.

It is also **silly**. If a packet does disappear along the way for some reason, it will just sit there and wait for it to reappear. There are ways to work around this, but this is the reason the protocol is slow. There will be a lot of retransmissions and confusion.

Some protocols that work over TCP:

- HTTP(S) for web pages
- FTP for old school file transfers
- SSH for server administration and other really cool stuff
- SMTP for email

> Again, here there will be a sketch on the 3-way handshake. Hang in there, or send me one over teams. Please don't have ChatGPT generate it, I could have asked it to do that myself but I have too much artistic integrity.

### UDP – User Datagram Protocol

So the UDP protocol is the Yolo protocol. The sender just fires off packets and then sort of shrugs. No connections are made, so we call it **connectionless**. The protocol will do no attempts at making sure the packets arrive in order, I mean it doesn't even attempt to guarantee that the packets arrive at all.

This makes the protocol **fast** and **lightweight**. Anytime we care more about the packages arriving quickly than arriving at all, we turn to UDP.

For that reason IoT folks really like working with UDP. First of all, if the temperature data doesn't arrive on time, who cares? There will be a new update in like 5 seconds and if the temperature has changed wildly in the space of five seconds **and then back** you have more serious problems to attend to.

Second of all, no one's stopping you from building reliability on top of the UDP protocol. You can have algorithms that check if there hasn't been temperature data coming in for a few minutes, and then ask the sensor to retransmit. You can have algorithms that checks for errors. You can do whatever you do on top of the UDP protocol, picking and choosing from what you like about the TCP protocol.

Use cases for UDP:

- DNS (which also can use TCP, so cool!) is what lets you type `reddit.com` in your web browser instead of `151.101.129.140`.
- DHCP which gives you an IP address automatically, instead of you having to ask IT about it every time.
- VoIP is a protocol for phone calls.
- Video streaming

Why does it make sense for these protocols to use UDP?

### Comparison Table

| Feature     | TCP             | UDP                  |
| ----------- | --------------- | -------------------- |
| Connection  | Yes (Handshake) | No                   |
| Reliability | Yes             | No                   |
| Ordering    | Guaranteed      | Not guaranteed       |
| Use Cases   | Web, SSH, Email | Streaming, DNS, VoIP |

## ICMP – Internet Control Message Protocol

### Purpose

We won't talk much about the ICMP protocol. It is used for diagnostics and error message, and regular users will not get in contact with it. Indeed, most advanced users will only ever use the type 8 and the type 0 parts of the protocol. They will not know this themselves, knowing only that they type:

```bash
ping 8.8.8.8
```

To see if they have an Internet connection.

### Common ICMP Message Types

| Type | Description             | Example Use     |
| ---- | ----------------------- | --------------- |
| 0    | Echo Reply              | `ping` response |
| 3    | Destination Unreachable | Routing failure |
| 8    | Echo Request            | `ping` request  |
| 11   | Time Exceeded           | `traceroute`    |

### Tools that use ICMP

- `ping`
- `traceroute`

Traceroute is kind of cool. How does that work? Do try to use it and see what happens!

## Byte Order and `htons`

### What is Byte Order?

Different CPU architectures represent multibyte numbers in different orders:

- **Little-endian**: Least significant byte first (e.g. x86)
- **Big-endian**: Most significant byte first (used in networking)

### What is `htons()`?

```cpp
uint16_t htons(uint16_t x);
```

- Stands for **Host to Network Short**.
- Converts a 16-bit value from **host byte order** to **network byte order**.

Example:

```cpp
uint16_t x = 0x1234;
uint16_t y = htons(x);
// On little-endian machine:
// x = 0x1234 → stored as 34 12
// htons(x) → converts to 12 34
```

## Working with Raw Sockets in C++

### What is a Raw Socket?

- A **socket that bypasses the normal TCP/UDP protocol processing**.
- Lets you manually construct packets (e.g., IP or ICMP).
- Requires **root privileges** (e.g., via `sudo` on Linux).

### System Call Example

```cpp
int sock = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_RAW, IPPROTO_ICMP);
```

- `AF_INET`: IPv4
- `SOCK_RAW`: Raw socket
- `IPPROTO_ICMP`: Protocol field for ICMP

### Address Conversion

```cpp
inet_pton(AF_INET, "8.8.8.8", &dest.sin_addr);
```

- Converts human-readable IP to binary form
- `inet_pton` = "presentation to network"

## ICMP Packet Construction (bonus)

We built an ICMP Echo Request packet manually using C++ and printed its contents in **hexadecimal**:

### ICMP Header Fields (RFC 792)

| Field      | Size | Description                          |
| ---------- | ---- | ------------------------------------ |
| Type       | 1 B  | Message type (8 = Echo Request)      |
| Code       | 1 B  | Subtype (0 for Echo)                 |
| Checksum   | 2 B  | Integrity check (over entire packet) |
| Identifier | 2 B  | Matches requests and replies         |
| Sequence   | 2 B  | Order of request packets             |

### Example Initialization in C++

```cpp
icmp->icmp_type = ICMP_ECHO;
icmp->icmp_code = 0;
icmp->icmp_id = htons(0x1234);
icmp->icmp_seq = htons(1);
```

### Checksum Calculation

```cpp
unsigned short checksum(void* b, int len);
```

- Sums every 16-bit word
- Folds result to 16 bits
- Returns the one's complement

### Dummy Payload

To fill the rest of the packet with sample data:

```cpp
for (int i = sizeof(struct icmp); i < packet_size; ++i)
    packet[i] = i;
```

## Printing the Packet in Hexadecimal

```cpp
void print_hex(const unsigned char* data, int length);
```

- Groups output 16 bytes per row
- Useful for **debugging**, **learning**, and **Wireshark comparison**

## Sending the Packet

```cpp
sendto(sock, packet, packet_size, 0, (sockaddr*)&dest, sizeof(dest));
```

- Sends the raw ICMP packet directly to the target
- No TCP or UDP layer involved

## Observing in Wireshark

Use Wireshark with the following filters:

- **`icmp`** → shows ICMP packets
- **`icmp.type == 8`** → Echo Requests
- **`icmp.type == 0`** → Echo Replies

Compare the bytes captured to your printed hexadecimal output.

## Summary of System Concepts

| Concept       | Summary                                             |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `htons()`     | Convert 16-bit value to network byte order          |
| `raw socket`  | Allows full manual control over packet construction |
| `inet_pton()` | Converts text IP to binary format                   |
| `sendto()`    | Sends data to a specific IP and port                |
| `checksum()`  | Ensures integrity of the packet header and payload  |
| `ICMP`        | Protocol for control messages, not transport        |

## Suggested Practice for Students

1. **Capture and decode** the packet in Wireshark
2. Modify and recompile:
   - Change identifier and sequence number
   - Change payload
3. Implement ICMP Echo Reply handling (advanced)
4. Try sending packets to a local IP address and observe behavior
5. **Build Your Stack**: Implement a UDP-based telemetry client on ESP32 using lwIP or Arduino Ethernet.
6. **Draw the Stack**: Create a layered diagram showing how an MQTT message travels from a sensor to a cloud service over WiFi.
7. **Header Field Identification**: Compare IP and TCP headers and explain what fields belong to which layer.

[^1]: Well, not _literally_ every piece of data. There are other protocols out there (like OSI, X.25, or even carrier pigeons), but let's not ruin the moment with technicalities. Your phone probably uses TCP/IP though, so we'll call it a win.
