# Deep Dive: Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) in IoT

## What is BLE?

**Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)** is a wireless communication protocol designed for **short-range, low-power** applications. Introduced in **Bluetooth 4.0**, it's optimized for periodic, small data transfers rather than continuous streaming.

BLE is ideal for:

- **Wearables** (fitness trackers, smartwatches)
- **Environmental sensors** (temperature, humidity)
- **Smart home gadgets** (door locks, light sensors)
- **Medical devices** (heart rate monitors, glucose sensors)

## BLE Architecture Overview

### BLE Stack Layers

| Layer            | Role                                        | Equivalent OSI/TCP-IP Layer |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Application**   | App logic, data model (GATT profiles)       | OSI Layers 5–7              |
| **GATT**          | Generic Attribute Profile (data organization) | Application                 |
| **ATT**           | Attribute Protocol (data access)            | Application                 |
| **L2CAP**         | Multiplexing, fragmentation                 | Transport                   |
| **SMP**           | Security Manager Protocol (pairing, keys)   | Session/Security            |
| **HCI**           | Host-Controller Interface                   | Interface to PHY            |
| **Link Layer**    | Connection, advertising, CRC, timing        | Data Link                   |
| **PHY Layer**     | Modulation, frequency hopping               | Physical                    |

BLE separates **host** (software) from **controller** (hardware/radio). These communicate using the **HCI protocol**.
## BLE Communication Paradigms

### 1. **Advertising**
- Devices broadcast packets periodically
- No connection required
- Used for discovery, beacons (e.g., iBeacon, Eddystone)
### 2. **Connections**
- After advertising, a central (e.g., phone) initiates a connection
- The peripheral enters a power-saving **sleep-wake cycle**
- Data is exchanged using **GATT characteristics**
### GATT in Practice
BLE defines a **hierarchical data model**:

- **Service**: Groups related characteristics (e.g., Heart Rate Service)
- **Characteristic**: A data point (e.g., Heart Rate Measurement)
- **Descriptors**: Metadata about characteristics

These are all represented as **UUIDs**, and accessed using the **Attribute Protocol (ATT)**.
## Frequency, Channels, and Modulation

BLE operates in the **2.4 GHz ISM band**, but differently from WiFi:

- **40 channels**:  
  - 3 **advertising** channels: 37, 38, 39  
  - 37 **data** channels  
- Each channel is **2 MHz wide**
- Uses **Gaussian Frequency-Shift Keying (GFSK)**:
  - More power-efficient than OFDM
  - Max rate: 1 Mbps (Bluetooth 4.0–4.1), up to 2 Mbps (Bluetooth 5+)
### Adaptive Frequency Hopping
BLE devices hop between channels to:
- Avoid **interference** from WiFi, microwave ovens, etc.
- Improve **resilience** in crowded 2.4 GHz environments
Hop interval is negotiated during connection setup.
## Power Optimization Strategies
BLE is designed to **maximize sleep time**:

- Devices stay in deep sleep most of the time
- Wake briefly to advertise, scan, or exchange data
- **Connection intervals**, **slave latency**, and **supervision timeouts** are tunable
### Example: Battery Life

- A BLE temperature sensor broadcasting every 5s can run for **months to years** on a coin cell
- By contrast, a WiFi-connected sensor waking every 5s would **drain the battery in days**

## Limitations of BLE

| Topology        | Star             | Infrastructure   | Mesh           | Star               |
| Best For        | Wearables, sensors | Streaming, hubs | Home automation | Remote sensing     |

## Suggested Practice

1. **BLE Sniffing**: Use a BLE sniffer (e.g., nRF52840 Dongle + Wireshark) to capture advertising packets.
2. **UUID Exercise**: Explore a real BLE GATT server (e.g., heart rate sensor) with a phone app like nRF Connect.
3. **Build a Peripheral**: Use an ESP32 or nRF52 to advertise a GATT service (e.g., temperature).
4. **Power Profiling**: Compare current draw between BLE advertising vs WiFi connection on the same board.
